# Fodder Game — Implementation TODO

Comprehensive checklist derived from [ENGINE.md](../../docs/ENGINE.md),
[PLAYER.md](../../docs/PLAYER.md), [ENEMY_AI.md](../../docs/ENEMY_AI.md), and
[TERRAIN_AND_OBJECTS.md](../../docs/TERRAIN_AND_OBJECTS.md).

Legend: ✅ = implemented, 🔶 = partial, ❌ = not started

---

## 1. Engine Fundamentals (ENGINE.md)

### 1.1 Timing
- [x] Engine tick system (50 Hz interrupt, 3 interrupts per tick ≈ 16.67 ticks/sec, ~60 ms/tick)
- [x] Currently using real-time `dt`; all spec tick values converted in `game_config.dart`
- [ ] `mMission_EngineTicks` counter incrementing once per engine loop

### 1.2 Coordinate System
- [x] Map tiles are 16×16 px (rendered at 2× = 32×32)
- [x] Sub-tile walkability uses 8×8 grid per tile
- [ ] 🔶 World positions use pixel floats; spec uses 16.16 fixed-point
- [ ] Height system: `field_1E_Big` (32-bit fixed-point height), `field_20` (pixel height above ground)

### 1.3 Direction System
- [x] 8-direction enum (`Direction8`) for animation selection
- [ ] 512-unit direction circle (0x000–0x1FE, even values only, 256 effective)
- [ ] Direction vector table (`mDirectionVectorTable[256]`) — sine lookup for movement deltas
- [ ] `Direction_Between_Points()` — 32×32 lookup table for dx/dy → direction
- [ ] Smooth turning interpolation via `mDirectionStepTable` (`field_3C` → `field_10`)
- [ ] Speed-direction modifier when firing while moving (24/20/14/10/8/10/14/20)

### 1.4 Sprite Limits
- [ ] Max 45 sprites total (`mSpritesMax`)
- [ ] General allocation range indices 0–42
- [ ] Bullet/low-priority range indices 0–29
- [ ] Reserved text overlay indices 40–42
- [ ] Sentinel sprite at index 44
- [x] Max 10 enemies on map (spawn cap — referenced in enemy spawning)

### 1.5 Person Types
- [x] 🔶 Faction enum exists (`player`/`enemy`); spec has 3 types: Human(0), AI(1), Native(2)
- [ ] Native person type for civilians/hostages

### 1.6 Sprite Struct Fields
- [ ] Most `sSprite` fields not modelled (`field_0` through `field_75`)
- [ ] `field_46` union (mission troop pointer / sprite pointer / raw int32)
- [ ] In-vehicle flag (`field_6E`), vehicle type (`field_6F`)
- [ ] Homing flag (`field_75 & 0x01`), invincibility flag (`field_75 & 0x02`)

### 1.7 Animation Groups
- [x] Walk (8 dirs), Firing (8 dirs), Throw (8 dirs), Death (8 dirs), Death2 (8 dirs)
- [x] Prone animation (8 dirs: player 0x10–0x17, enemy 0x52–0x59)
- [x] Swim animation (8 dirs: player 0x18–0x1F, enemy 0x5A–0x61)
- [ ] Death3 animation (8 dirs: player 0x30–0x37, enemy 0x72–0x79) — not in atlas
- [ ] Rocket animation (8 dirs: player 0x39–0x40, enemy 0xA8–0xAF) — not in atlas
- [ ] Slide animations (`eSprite_Anim_Slide1–3`, values 0x32–0x34) — not in atlas

---

## 2. Player Soldiers (PLAYER.md)

### 2.1 Health & Survivability
- [x] One-hit kill (no hitpoints)
- [x] Dodge mechanic: moving soldiers have 1/8 chance to dodge bullets
- [x] Dodge blocked when stationary
- [ ] Dodge works in water or sinking (`field_52 ≥ 5`)
- [x] Dodge blocked at very close range (`field_3A ≤ 4` → bullet age ≤ 0.24s)
- [ ] Invincibility flag (`field_75 & 0x02`) from bonus pickups

### 2.2 Death Animation States
- [x] Standard bullet death — random death/death2 variant
- [ ] Run-over / explosion death (`eSprite_Anim_Die1`)
- [ ] Drowning death (`eSprite_Anim_Die3`)
- [ ] Spike death (`eSprite_Anim_Die5`)
- [ ] Terrain sliding (`eSprite_Anim_Slide1–3`)

### 2.3 Movement Speeds
- [x] Player speed determined by squad's SpeedMode (halted/normal/running)
- [x] Halted/slow: 8 (mode 0) → 40 px/s
- [x] Normal walk: 16 (mode 1) → 80 px/s
- [x] Running (default): 24 (mode 2) → 120 px/s
- [x] In water/sinking: forced to 6 → 30 px/s
- [x] Speed modes switchable per squad (starts at mode 2 = running)

### 2.4 Controls
- [x] Left-click → set walk target (waypoint)

- [x] Up to 9 soldiers allocated per mission
- [ ] Rank icons from `RANKFONT` sprite sheet (frame index = rank)
- [x] Promotion formula: `new_rank = min(current_rank + phases_survived, 15)`
- [x] Promotion is phase-survival-based, NOT kill-based
- [x] `phaseCount` increments each phase survived, resets each mission



### 2.10 Rank Effects on Weapon Stats
- [x] `mSprite_Bullet_UnitData[26]` table indexed by `min(rank + 8, 15)`
- [x] Ranks 0–7 have unique weapon stats (table indices 8–15)

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 5.1 Weapons (WEAPONS.md)
- [ ] Player bullets: rank-based speed/range/cooldown/deviation
- [ ] Enemy bullets: aggression-based speed/range, fixed 24 spread
- [ ] Bullet spread/deviation system (random angular deviation mask)
- [ ] Max 20 concurrent bullets per side
- [ ] Grenades: arcing projectile, gravity 0x18000/tick, bounce ≥ 8 = dud, max 2 in flight
- [ ] Helicopter grenades: drop straight (no arc)
- [ ] Rockets: speed 100, max 2, 6-tick delay between shots, homing vs straight
- [ ] Missiles: straight (acceleration to max 96) vs homing (different turn rates)
- [ ] Lock-on distance: 22 px
- [ ] Explosions: 7 or 4 frames, faction-neutral, alternating damage, 25-position tile destruction, chain reactions

### 5.2 Vehicles (VEHICLES.md)
- [ ] Helicopters: 32 px cruise altitude, max speed 48, climb/descent, 4 weapon variants
- [ ] Enemy helicopter AI: 500 aggression threshold, 250 px detection, bullet-invulnerable
- [ ] Helicopter call pad
- [ ] Tanks: max speed 24, missile speed 60, 16-direction turret offsets
- [ ] Jeeps: armed/unarmed, cannon speed = vehicle + 80
- [ ] Turrets: 210 px detection, 1/32–1/64 fire chance, invulnerable variants
- [ ] Vehicle enter/exit: 13 px entry distance, animations
- [ ] Vehicle sinking, looping vehicles

### 5.3 UI & Meta
- [ ] Squad selection sidebar
- [ ] Rank icon display (`RANKFONT` sprite sheet)
- [ ] Kill counter / score display
- [ ] Heroes graveyard screen
- [ ] Recruit roster (360 names from `Recruits.cpp`)
- [ ] Mission briefing / service screen
- [ ] Game over when all 360 recruits killed
- [ ] Campaign progression (missions → phases)

### 5.4 Audio
- [ ] Death sounds (random per death)
- [ ] Weapon sounds (bullet, grenade, rocket, explosion)
- [ ] Vehicle sounds (helicopter, tank)
- [ ] Ambient / terrain sounds
- [ ] Music (`.adl` / `.rol` tracker files from original)

### 5.5 Camera & Rendering
- [ ] Camera panning (follow player squad)
- [ ] Scalable view window (4× or window-fit)
- [ ] Z-ordering by Y position (southern sprites on top)
- [ ] Sprite priority system matching original allocation zones

### 5.6 Input
- [x] Right-click on web (context menu blocks it)
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts (squad switching, speed modes)

---

## 6. Bugs (Known)

- [ ] Clicking unwalkable area should path to nearest walkable cell
- [ ] Z-order: sprites should sort by Y position (south on top)
- [ ] When a solider dies, their corpse should remain visible.
- [x] The bullets coming from the enemeires start at the wrong position relative to the enermy sprite
- [x] When the player fire, they squat, which seems wrong.
- [x] The bullets go though trees, etc
- [x] The bullets seem to go forever

## 7. Other

- [ ] Change path finding to consider cost of different terrain
- [ ] Optionally show enemy detection radii in debug overlay
- [ ] Can debug overlay work like the Tiles, so its cheaper to render
- [ ] Add loading screen (and pre-loading on html page)
